# Philosophy
      If we want to do something FIRST we have to know what we want

## what we want ?
	Getting placed
	okay... 
	we take our goal as Getting placed in a marquee company (>20LPA)
	
## how this placement works
	It is a simple process of presenting our self to someone who knows nothing about ourselfs. 
	To make them decide whether we suit for the role or not.
	
### General steps invloved in this placements

1. Screening 
2. Analyzing 
3. Evaluating

#### Iteration 1
	Screening 
		This is an general process to eliminate some amount of crowd from the interview process.
	Analyzing
		Technical skills will be analyzed. 
	Evaluating 
		How You are!! will be evaluated.
		
		
#### Iteration 2
	Screening 
		Aptitude, english questions round.
		Diffucilty level will depend upon the companies.
	Analyzing
		Programming round.
		We can take any language (language that supports OOPS will be much appreciated)
		Should be able to solve Medium to hard level problems
	Evaluating 
		Technical and behavioral round.
		Tech
			1. Programming Language
			2. OS, DBMS, CN, DS&ALGO, OOPS
			3. Full knowledge about project
			4. UNIX, Web techonologies(some times)
			5. General puzzles (some times)
		System design 
			Some of the companies will have this round.
			clear understanding of basics will help
		Behavioural 
			Atitude, Motivation are considered. 
			sometimes conflicting questions will asked, following one flow is encouraged. 
			eg( for interview shake someone told they read books alot but they didn't, 
			when the converstion getting further with books lagging or trying change the coverstion direction 
			will be clearly noticed and makes bad impression)
			
Interview process will be subjected to companies strategy

	Some companies keep behavioural interview first and then keep the technical interview

	Some will combine aptitude and coding into single round 

	Some will combine techinical and behavioural into a single round 

## what ever the strategy is THE BASE WILL BE ALLWAYS SAME!!
