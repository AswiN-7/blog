__programme__ = *to make something work or act automatically in a particular way(google)*.

in our context that something is computer!! So we are going to deal with `computer programming`.

to make something work in a particular way we have to communicate with that something right!  
So to communicate, We need a communication tool. This communication tool can be named as `language` 

# Language

First, what is a language?  

  A language is communication tool that is used to share our views, idea, thoughts to others by speaking, writing, actions etc...  
  what are all the background things that automatically happening when we are communicating   
  here we take a conversation between two people as a analogy
  
  When two people are speaking..   
  What are the things(rules) that should be followed between them to make the communication to be understandable by both them
  * Both should understand what they are speaking this is first for this both them should speak a language which is known by them if one is speaking some language which is not known to other means communication itself could not be happen
  * Both should use words which known to both them so both of them understand the same meaning 
  * Words are supposed to be structured ie collectively all the words we speak should have some order in that like subject-verb-object and a clear meaning 
  * These are some of the rules..
    
Now, let us move towards computer

Assume a person want to communicate with computer  
for this both of them should know a language which is understood by both of them i.e `computer programming language`


# Computer Programming Language

People created this Computer Programming Language(CPL) to communicate with computer and make them work in a particular way as they want
This CPL has some specific set of rules and regulations  
We going to see that in upcomming episodes


my things for packed trip yesterday itself I tomorrow's  

Did you understand anything from this?   
Not right   
But you can understand all words individually but collectively it doesn't mean anything  
Why its happened  

Order of words is not correct  
This is called syntax  
I packed my things yesterday itself for tomorrow's trip  
Likewise computer language has syntax   
Computer will be like   
If you want to tell me something, tell me in Certain order or else I wont read that.
