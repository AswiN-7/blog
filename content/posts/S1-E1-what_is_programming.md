__programme__ = *to make something work or act automatically in a particular way(google)*.

in our context that something is computer!! So we are going to deal with `computer programming`.

to make something work in a particular way we have to communicate with that something right!  
So to communicate, We need a communication tool. This communication tool can be named as `language` 

# Language

First, what is a language?  

  A language is communication tool that is used to share our views, idea, thoughts to others by speaking, writing, actions etc...  
  what are all the background things that automatically happening when we are communicating   
  here we take a conversation between two people as a analogy
  
  When two people are speaking..   
  What are the things(rules) that should be followed between them to make the communication to be understandable by both them
  * Both should understand what they are speaking this is first for this both them should speak a language which is known by them if one is speaking some language which is not known to other means communication itself could not be happen
  * Both should use words which known to both them so both of them understand the same meaning 
  * Words are supposed to be structured ie collectively all the words we speak should have some order in that like subject-verb-object and a clear meaning 
  * These are some of the rules..
    
Now, let us move towards computer

Assume a person want to communicate with computer  
for this both them should know a language which is understood by both of them i.e `computer programming language`


# Computer Programming Language

People created this Computer Programming Language to communicate with computer and make them work in a particular way as they want

எனக்கு நம்மாழ்வார் என்றால் மிகவும் பிடிக்கும்  
I would love it if it is Nammazhvar  
Nammazhvarなら私はそれが大好きです(Nammazhvarnara watashi wa sore ga daisukidesu)  


From this we understand that language doesn't matter u r thought can be expressed in any language 
But what is important while u expressing something

THE COMMUNICATING PROCEDURE 

pari=kuthirai






An important point here to add is 

What language we speak is not important what we speak is important 
So don't be worried if you dunno some language and at the same time don't be in vain if u know some language(# kathu vakula oru karuthu) 

Like this while u talking to computer u should know the language that computers know 
This is why u should learn programming language which is known by computer 


நான்  போக நேத்து எடுத்து  துனி  நாளைக்கு ஊருக்கு வச்சிட்டேன்.

Did you understand anything from this not right 
But you can understand all words individually but collectively it doesn't mean anything
Why its happened

Order of words is not correct 
This is called syntax

For tamil words are supposed to be in SVO form subject verb object 

நான் நாளைக்கு ஊருக்கு போக நேத்தே துனி எடுத்து வச்சிட்டேன்.
Likewise computer language has syntax 
Computer will be like 
If you want to tell me something, tell me in this order or else I wont read that. 

note
In japanese word order is sov 
Instead of telling i ate apple they will say i apple ate  


Okay now let us dive into c programming language
