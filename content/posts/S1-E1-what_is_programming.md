Language

First, what is the use of a language?

 To share your views, idea, thoughts to others

எனக்கு நம்மாழ்வார் என்றால் மிகவும் பிடிக்கும்
I would love it if it is Nammazhvar
Nammazhvarなら私はそれが大好きです(Nammazhvarnara watashi wa sore ga daisukidesu)


From this we understand that language doesn't matter u r thought can be expressed in any language 
But what is important while u expressing something

THE COMMUNICATING PROCEDURE 

pari=kuthirai


When two members are speaking 
What are the rules should be followed between them to make the communication in understandable way
Both should understand what they are speaking this is first for this both them should speak a language which is known by them if one is speaking some language which is not known to other means communication itself could not be happen
Both should use words which known to both them and both understand the same meaning 
Words are supposed to be structured ie collectively all the words u speak should have some order like svo and a clear meaning 
These are some rules..



An important point here to add is 

What language we speak is not important what we speak is important 
So don't be worried if you dunno some language and at the same time don't be in vain if u know some language 

Like this while u talking to computer u should know the language that computers know 
This is why u should learn programming language which is known by computer 


நான்  போக நேத்து எடுத்து  துனி  நாளைக்கு ஊருக்கு வச்சிட்டேன்.

Did you understand anything from this not right 
But you can understand all words individually but collectively it doesn't mean anything
Why its happened

Order of words is not correct 
This is called syntax

For tamil words are supposed to be in SVO form subject verb object 

நான் நாளைக்கு ஊருக்கு போக நேத்தே துனி எடுத்து வச்சிட்டேன்.
Likewise computer language has syntax 
Computer will be like 
If you want to tell me something, tell me in this order or else I wont read that. 

note
In japanese word order is sov 
Instead of telling i ate apple they will say i apple ate  


Okay now let us dive into c programming language
