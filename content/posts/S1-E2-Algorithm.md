Algorithm
Let's say a stranger person is coming to you and asking how to go to certain place if you know that location you start giving them instructions right like

Go straight 
Turn left
Walk 5 meters and again turn left
You will reach the that place 

Likewise in computer science, computer is the stranger to you and computer dunno anything above 0s and 1s so you have give it some instructions 

For example if a computer comes to and asks 
Hey man, how to check whether a person is able to vote or not?
What will u say

Ask them their age 
If the age is greater than or equal to 18 
Tell them they can able to vote
Else, tell them they cant able to vote

This is called algorithm 
A set instructions that followed by somebody to reach the solution
