Algorithm
Let's say a stranger person is coming to you and asking how to go to certain place  
if you know that location you start giving them instructions right  
like..

 Go straight   
 Turn left  
 Walk 5 meters and again turn left  
 You will reach the that place   

Likewise in computer science, computer is the stranger to you  
computer dont know anything above 0s and 1s   
so you have to give instructions to it 
(whenever you give instructions to computer you should be like this is first time regardless of how many times you it already)

For example if a computer comes to you and asks   
Hey, how to check whether a person is able to vote or not?  
What will u say  

Ask them their age   
If the age is greater than or equal to 18   
Tell them they can able to vote  
Else, tell them they cant able to vote  

sample algorithm 

Step 1 : Input Age   
Step 2 : IF Age >= 18 then  
           print "Yes"  
         ELSE  
           print "NO"  
         END IF  
Step 3 : END  

This is called algorithm   
A set instructions that is given by someone, to be followed, by someone to reach the solution.
