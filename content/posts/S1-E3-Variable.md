Variable
Let us take a pen 
What are all the parts it has 
Cap 
Ink chamber
Barrel

Using that ink chamber itself we can write but it will somewhat hard in long run right 
So we are using a barrel to hold that ink chamber and we are holding that barrel and we are writing this makes writing process somewhat smooth right
Here 
data = ink chamber 
Barrel = variable 

Variable will hold data 
Using this variable we can manipulate data

Example 
Int a = 5;
a is the variable 
5 is the data
Now a will hold 5
Int is data type
