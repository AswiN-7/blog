Variable  
Let us take this pen   
What are all the parts it has   
* Ink chamber
* Barrel
* Ball Point Tip
* Tip
* Spring 

What is the aim of this pen just to write on a paper

if we take the ink in our fingers and start writing our hands become dirt   
so we use a Ink Chamber to hold the ink and to control ink flow we use BallPointTip  

combining this InkChamer and BallPointTip we can write but it is small in width holding this for long time in fingers is hard  
so we use Barrel that hold this which helps as to hold very easily and write smoothly     

Here 

Data = InkChamber   
Variable = Barrel    

## what is data 
Data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine.

Data is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,*,<,>,= etc.)

what about images, videos they are converted into 0s and 1s to store
actually all this alphabets, digits, special characters are stored as 0s and 1s only 
will discuss about that in someother season


Variable will hold data 
Using this variable we can manipulate data

Example  
Int a = 5;  
a is the variabl  e 
5 is the data  
Now `a` will hold `5`  
Int is data type  
will discusses about data type in next episode...
