Computer Science
Is computer science against nature?

In this world if something is against nature it can’t grow

using this statement we will prove that computer science is not against nature

Let's take a small analogy here 

Assume there is family 

Father mother son are in that family 

a good and nice family 

Can the son of that family can do something against parents words and can he survive in this world he cant right 

Is this small circle itself we can't do that 

Then how something that against nature can grow like this 

Cs is aligned with nature and it is an exact mimic of nature 

In this course will see how computer science aligned its nature with nature 

Computer Science = CS = Common Sense

>What is computer science

>>What is science

>>>Science is the study of knowing about something 

>>What is computer 

>>>This computer came from the word computation 

>>>What is this computation 

>>>>Computation a way of processing 

>>>>What is this processing 

>>>>>Take something => do something to it => now a new thing is formed from that something
This is called processing 
Example :
We take mother and her none retirement duty as our example here 
What our mothers are doing daily morning 
She take some raw vegetables, rice, oil etc (Taking something)
Cooking them (do something)
Giving as food (new thing we got) 

>>>>Computation is processing for our need 
Hey system add 3 and 4 and give me the answer 
This is an computation
Here u give 3, 4, + to computer 
Computer does addition
Give u the result 7

>>>Computer is device which will do computation for us

>>Computer science is study of knowing something about computation  and its devices


 Situation | Input | Processing | Output|
--- | :---: | ---: | ---: |
In cooking |  Raw vegetables, rice|mom’s love and effort + Vessels + Fire| food |
In computer science | Numbers,strings | lots of people interest and effort + Transistors + electricity | result | 






Proof 1:
Cs is exact mimic of nature
